[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> `Avg weight (lbs): firsts=7.20, others=7.33, diff=-0.12`  
>> `Std (lbs): firsts=1.421, others=1.394195`  
>> `Cohen's Effect Factor(firsts, others) for birth weight=-0.088673`  
>>
>> **Conclusion:** While first babies are lighter on average, the effect size is
     **small** (0.01 .. 0.2) according to
     [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d)
>>
>> `Avg pregnancy length (weeks): firsts=38.60, others=38.52, diff=0.08`  
>> `Cohen's Effect Factor(firsts, others) for pregnancy length=0.028879`  
>>
>> **Conclusion:** While first baby pregancies are longer on average
     (i.e. opposite direction than weight) the side effect is both small as per
     Cohen's d and insignificant in meaning (.08 weeks = 0.56 days = 13 hrs)
